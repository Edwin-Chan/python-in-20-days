# Introduction to Python

Welcome to the Python tutorial. I will start off by introducing a little bit about Python and some reasons to learn Python

#### Brief History
1. Guido von Rossum started to create Python compiler during Christmas 1989.
2. Python compiler uses C language in the background. 
3. Python 1.0 was released in January 1994.
4. Python 2.0 was released on Oct 16 2000, and supports garbage collection and Unicode.
5. Python 3.0 was leased on Dec 3 2008, with changes to syntax as compared to Python 2.0, and lead to some incompatabilities. 


#### Advantages and Disadvantages of Python

## Advantages
1. Easy to understand.
2. Learning curve is mild
3. Open source with a large community surrounding it.
4. Descriptive language with a lot of encapsulation.
5. Can embed different programming languages in your code, eg C/C++.
6. High Readability.

## Disadvantages
1. Lower efficiency, as compared to C/C++
2. Too many frameworks to choose from, a lot of decisions have to be made
3. Cannot encrypt the code(as compared to javaScript where you can minify)


#### Where is Python used?

Python is currently oftenly used in Web-dev, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud infrastructures, WebCrawllers etc. Therefore, in order to prepare for future jobs, it is best to have some experience in Python. 



#### Setting up

Now after going through some introductions, let's get started with setting up the environment!

## Windows: 
Go to the [Python official website](https://www.python.org) , install the Python version for windows, install Python 3.x which we shall be using throughout the tutorial.

## MacOS:

MacOS has its own Python 2.x version installed. However, since we will be using Python 3.x in this course, it is advised to go to [Python official website](https://www.python.org) and install the version. 

#### Ensuring correct Installation

In the terminal, try typing 
```
python3 -V
```
and if it returns 
Python 3.x.x

then you are all set!

Now lets get started!!

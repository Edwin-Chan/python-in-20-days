# Loop and Iterating Strings

#### Introduction to Loops:
In the execution of programs, if we want to do repetitive executions of specific instructions, then we would have to continue to send consecutive instructions. However, we should not be repeated typing the instruction for that many times, or else our code will be hardly readable. Therefore, we will have to utilize loops in our program to display such properties, and to execute certain instructions repeatedly.

In programming, there are two kinds of loops: 'for' loops and 'while' loops.

While in Python, there are two types, 'for-in' and 'while'


#### 'For-in' loops
If you explicitly know the number of iterations that you are running, or iterating a container(to be discussed in further chapters), then 'for-in' loop is suggested.
